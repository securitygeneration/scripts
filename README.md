Random scripts
=======

I'll put some of my random scripts in here until they warrant their own repo.

* ssh_authenum.sh: Test list of hosts/IPs for supported SSH authentication types
* pskdump.sh: Dumps IKE Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) of list of hosts/IPs
* nsesearch.sh: Searches for nmap NSE scripts and prints out help, usage, parameters and sample output
* openports.sh: Prints out all hosts that have the specified port(s) open in gnmap file
* changeMAC.sh: Change Wifi interface MAC address on macOS >= 10.10
* redirector.sh: Follows URLs supplied in a file and outputs HTTP redirects (also reports SSL errors)
